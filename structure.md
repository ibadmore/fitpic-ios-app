# FitPic - App Structure & Implementation

*Current iOS App MVP Structure - Updated December 2024*

## Project Overview

FitPic is an AI-powered style recommendation app built as a responsive web application designed for iOS devices. The app helps users discover personalized outfit suggestions based on their style preferences, weather conditions, and occasions.

## Application Architecture

### Single Page Application Structure
The app is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) with multiple views managed through JavaScript navigation:

1. **Entry Page** (`#entry-page`) - Authentication and welcome
2. **Onboarding Flow** (`#onboarding-page`) - 6-step user setup
3. **Processing Page** (`#processing-page`) - AI analysis animation
4. **Home Feed** (`#home-page`) - Outfit discovery and browsing
5. **Outfit Detail** (`#outfit-detail-page`) - Individual outfit details

### Design Philosophy Foundation

#### Daybreak Studio Design DNA
- **Confident Minimalism** - Every element serves a purpose, nothing is decorative
- **Generous Negative Space** - Content breathes, hierarchy is clear through space
- **Bold Typography** - Strong, geometric letterforms that command attention
- **Purposeful Motion** - Animations guide understanding, never distract
- **Premium Materials** - Subtle gradients, soft shadows, tactile interactions
- **Human-Centered Technology** - Complex systems feel simple and intuitive

#### FitPic Visual Language
- **Modular Grid Systems** - 3x3 clothing pattern grids as core visual identity
- **Halftone Textures** - Technical printing aesthetics suggesting AI precision
- **Systematic Color Palette** - Charcoal (#0A0A0A), Cool Gray (#6B6B6B), Electric Blue (#0066FF)
- **Geometric Confidence** - Sharp edges, perfect alignment, mathematical harmony
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Information revealed contextually, not all at once
- **Contextual Intelligence** - UI adapts to user state, weather, calendar, mood
