#### 2. Add Dark Mode Toggle
- [x] Add dark mode toggle button to expanded navigation
- [x] Implement dark mode CSS variables and styles

- [x] Store dark mode preference in localStorage

#### 3. Update Navigation Styling
- [x] Position collapsed home button in left corner
- [x] Style expanded navigation panel
- [x] Add smooth expand/collapse animations
- [x] Ensure navigation works across all pages consistently

#### 4. Update Navigation JavaScript
- [x] Add toggle function for expand/collapse
- [x] Update navigation visibility functions
- [x] Add dark mode toggle functionality
- [x] Ensure navigation state persists across page transitions

#### 5. Test and Finalize
- [x] Test navigation on all pages
- [x] Verify dark mode toggle works correctly
- [x] Ensure responsive behavior
- [x] Test animation smoothness

### Key Requirements
- Navigation collapses into small home button in left corner

## Review
âœ… **Completed Implementation**

**Outfit Detail Changes:**
- Centered category navigation icons by adding `justify-content: center` to `.category-nav-scroll`
- Tags were already positioned correctly above category navigation
- Added comprehensive clothing filter functionality with `setupCategoryFiltering()` function
- Created product data structure with 5 categories (shirts, t-shirts, shoes, jackets, pants)
- Implemented dynamic product grid updates when category buttons are clicked
- Added CSS styling for "no products" message

**Favorites & Settings Navigation Changes:**
- Changed `hideNavigation()` to `showNavigation()` in `navigateToFavs()` and `navigateToSettings()`
- This removes navigation warnings and properly shows nav bar on these pages
- Navigation icon text removal coordinated with Agent 7 for global nav consistency

All changes maintain app functionality while improving user experience and navigation flow.
